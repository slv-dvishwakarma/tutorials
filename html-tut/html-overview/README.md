## What is HTML

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, which is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It defines the structure of a web page using a series of elements. These HTML elements provide instructions to the browser on how to display content, such as indicating headings, paragraphs, or links. Through these elements, HTML organizes and formats various components of a webpage, ensuring that content appears correctly and consistently across different web browsers.
