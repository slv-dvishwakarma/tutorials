## How to Create HTML File

1. **Open a Text Editor:** Start by opening a simple text editor like Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac).

2. **Write HTML Code:** In the text editor, write your HTML code. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

    ```bash
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>My First HTML Page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
        <p>This is my first HTML file.</p>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

3. **Save the File:** Save the file with an `.html` extension. For example, `index.html`.


4. **View in Browser:** Open the saved HTML file in a web browser to see how it looks. You can do this by double-clicking the file.


5. **Edit and Test:** Make changes to your HTML file in the text editor, save them, and refresh the browser to see the updates.
