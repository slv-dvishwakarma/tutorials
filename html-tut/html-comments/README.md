## HTML â€“ COMMENTS

In HTML, comments are used to add notes or explanations within the code that are not displayed in the web browser. Comments can be useful for documenting your code, providing context, or temporarily disabling parts of the code without removing them entirely.

Here's how comments are structured in HTML:

```bash

<!-- This is a comment in HTML -->

```

## Example Usage:

```bash

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>HTML Comment Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- This is a comment -->
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This paragraph contains some content.</p>
    <!--
        This is a multi-line comment.
        It can span across multiple lines.
    -->
</body>
</html>
```
